# Getting Started with tai-mcp

tai-mcp is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that gives AI agents the power to send, receive, and manage emails. Your agent gets its own email address and can handle email workflows autonomously.

## What is tai-mcp?

tai-mcp bridges the gap between AI agents and email communication. It provides four essential email tools through the MCP protocol:

- **send_email** - Send emails with markdown support
- **fetch_email** - Retrieve and read incoming emails
- **list_inbox** - Browse and manage your inbox  
- **reply_email** - Respond with proper email threading

Your agent operates with its own unique email address: `{INSTANCE}.{NAME}@tai.chat`
